Most, if not all, of the scripts presented here will need to be modified to work in your environment. My cascade_ws/auth_user.php has been omited here but I wanted to take a moment to explain that mine has one additional piece of logic that changes the WSDL URL based on the system I'm acting upon, production or test. My scripts usually use p or t as the first argument to specify this.
